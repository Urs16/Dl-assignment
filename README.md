Overview
Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is a powerful ensemble learning technique that extends its benefits to deep learning models. In the realm of deep learning, where complex neural networks often suffer from overfitting and high variance, bagging proves to be a valuable strategy for enhancing model robustness and generalization.

How Bagging Works in Deep Learning
In the context of deep learning, bagging involves training multiple instances of a neural network, each on a different subset of the training data. This process introduces diversity among the models, mitigating the risk of overfitting to specific patterns within the data. The predictions from these diverse models are then aggregated, commonly through techniques like averaging or voting, to produce a final ensemble prediction.
